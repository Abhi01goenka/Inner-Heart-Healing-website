                    "I, Karuna Chakraborty, with immense gratitude to Pradeep Sir wish to share my experience so that others may also believe in energy healing and get benefitted. It's about my chachaji who had fever since a few days so on 4th April I took him to Dr and some pathology test as his only son lives in Delhi. But that night his O2 level dropped so my cousin brother also rushed from Delhi and we admitted him in SKD hospital. But same day evening his condition deteriorated so we were asked to take him to another hospital. At this crucial time suddenly I got a call from Pradeep Sir and asked him to bless chachaji as well as the situations because many things were not in favor  that time i.e., getting bed etc.
                </p>
                <p className="text-neutral-400 dark:text-neutral-400 text-xl md:text-2xl max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center italic font-bold">
                    We shifted him to Sahara hospital where he was tested positive. The very same day healing was started by Sir.  On 3rd day in the night at 2 , he had a cardiac arrest and the condition became worse. As I informed Sir,  he took a lot of pain and started healing him thrice a day.  Chachaji was on ventilator for 6-7 days. I and my brother was also at risk so Sir healed us also and luckily till date we are safe. From 8th April my father also had fever and mild symptoms so Sir started his healing as well.  Although my father's fever persisted for 13-14 days but with no harm to lungs. Gradually after 5-6 days of healing, chachaji started recovering. It's very sad to say that nobody in such a critical situation survived in that Covid ward except chachaji and he was discharged from hospital after 18days i.e., on 23rd April. I'm telling this in detail as everyone was very critical there and receiving the same treatment but an additional thing with chachaji was energy healing which made the miracle happen. All through this turmoil Sir's support and his healing was always with us. Of course God's grace is the biggest but as I believe God's grace works through healing. Thank you so much Sir and ma'am for always being there for me in not only this but many crucial stages of my life."

                    Myself and my Father were suffering from Covid and while I had more or less recovered, my Father's condition became critical by 24-04 night and 25-04 morning. After a harrowing experience running around the whole day we finally managed to get Him admitted in AIIMS Jhajjar. Next evening, while I was waiting outside for His bed allotment, I got a msg from Dr. Anjali Pathak ji to call Pradeep ji for Energy Healing for my Father, which I promptly did. Pradeep ji started sending healing to my Father the same night, however destiny had other plans and my Father received the healing just once on 26-04 night and a few hours later left his mortal body for the Lotus Feet of the Guru and Lord Mahamrityunjaya.. we had to honour the Soul's decision to exit and accepted it as God's will..  🙏🏻🙏🏻

                    Four days later ie on 30-04, after we managed to complete the cremation and other rituals, my Father's attendant boy, Rohit and I, who were alone at home, also tested positive for Covid. We barely had time to grieve when all the focus shifted to our own health and keeping ourselves upright. We had an online consultation with a good doctor and he started our treatment. By 02-05, both Rohit's and mine SpO2 levels had started lowering. Pradeep ji had been sending us healing all through but suddenly the importance of Energy Healing became very apparent to me. Not only were Rohit and I physically affected, we were also mentally and emotionally traumatised after the demise of my Father. Pradeep ji spent a good number of hours talking and pacifying me on the phone, as I was panicking especially due to the boy Rohit's condition. Pradeep ji really helped calm me down and changed my entire energy so that I was able to take timely corrective action viz. the Rhythmic Breathing exercise as taught by Pradeep ji. The exercise was not easy for Rohit to learn, as he is a simple village boy, but by next day he had learnt it well and was able to see the rise in SpO2 levels, so he became diligent in doing the exercise himself. The Rhythmic Breathing exercises done continuously for 4-5 days have raised Rohit's SpO2 levels from 90 to 96 and he is now very motivated to increase his SpO2 levels and his target is 99.

                    At one point during our treatment, Rohit's SpO2 levels started dipping again despite regular steroids and other medicines. It was Pradeep ji's steady guidance and calming influence and the Rhythmic Breathing exercises and most importantly, the Energy Healing done by Pradeep ji which really helped us overcome the scary situation all over again.

                    The main point of this testimonial is to let everyone know about the effects of Energy Healing. While it is extremely difficult to qualitatively explain something as intangible as Energy Healing, I will try to share our experience. From Day 1 we had been receiving Energy Healing but since we were running around at the Cremation Ground and later at Garhmukteshwar, we were not always able to lie down and receive the healing in silence. However, after our treatment started we made it a point to lie down and receive the grace, which really worked it's way in our bodies and cleansed and healed us of the heavy negative energy of the virus. On 01-05 at the time of Crystal Healing, first Rohit and a little while after him, I suddenly felt so heavily sleepy that we immediately went and lay down on our respective beds. In fact Rohit was so sleepy all of a sudden that he almost dropped the mug he was holding. He slept off as if drugged but I was half awake and I could feel very powerful energy working in my body in the different parts and chakras etc. My Father and I had been following Shiv Yog for many years and so were energy sensitive. During the Crystal Healing I could especially feel a lot of energy working in the throat chakra as I was getting a lot of tightness in the throat chakra and a lot of cough. And then it all got released. I could also feel a lot of other negative or gross energy in other parts of the body and chakras get cleansed. The same experience happened everyday especially during the powerful Crystal Healing and Extraction Healing.

                    I am very positive and sure that the regular Energy Healing and the Crystal Healing given by Pradeep ji over the last 15 days has cleansed the negative energy of the virus and it's effects from our bodies and chakras and now both Rohit and I are on the upward cycle of healing and complete recovery. Not only that, I am now also much calmer and accepting of my Father's moving on and am focussing on my daily Swadhyaya and Sadhana for inner peace. I am also keen on learning Energy Healing from Pradeep ji's Trust as I have been getting a strong inner feeling that it would help me align with my life's purpose and with my Higher Self.

                    Atma Namaste 🙏<br />
                    Before I start, I would like to thank you sir on behalf of my each n every family member for your crucial n valuable support in our critical time. When my mother tested Covid positive, we also got our tests done, as expected , all 8 of 10 members, who even consisted people aged 55yrs, 15yrs n even a 8.5 months pregnant lady, it was really a very traumatizing situation for all of us. But with God's grace, nobody showed as strong symptoms except me. Within no time, my mother , Mrinalini tripathi, who is also a asthmatic patient , was admitted to d hospital. And soon was my turn n gradually others as well to get admitted in the hospital. Meanwhile., we were all home quarantined.<br />
                    Amid such circumstances, my cousin asked me to contact SHARNAGATI ASHRAM<br />
                    , where I had a word with PRADEEP SIR. Honestly confessing, at that time, he came to us as a blessing in disguise to rescue me and my family from this devastating situation. Initially, I was encountering high fever n worse tonsillitis and coughing . Soon my energy healing started, where I got valuable guidance from sir, wherein my mother n I even attended regular meditation sessions and online satsanga programme as well which pacified us mentally and psychologically. Soon my temperature went down and my tonsillitis issue was also resolved within no time and all family members started recovering including my mom who remained so calm bereft of any anxiety even in the hospital.<br />
                    Trust me, energy healing sessions really worked as a miracle. All of us recovered within 10 days and my mother got discharged on 12th day.<br />
                    Thankyou sir n ma'am for your valuable efforts n guidance, I would highly recommend energy healing to all my near and dear ones n the needy."
